# WotC Underground Overground

A simple mod which removes sewer and subway plots from the game.

This includes guerilla operations, missions to destroy an underground
transmitter, and for completeless, multiplayer maps and test maps.

The mod does not remove the "swarm defense" subway plot, since swarm
defense may still spawn, and we need to give it at least one valid
plot to spawn into.

The mod also adjusts one large outdoor town map to allege that it is
in tunnels, since with narrative enabled, the game tries to force us
into tunnels for the first guerilla operation, so that we can truly
appreciate the majesty of a frickin' sewer. So we redirect it to this
peaceful outdoor suburb in the sunshine.
