# Narrative Honcho

This mod and its source code are based very heavily on Narrative Control by
KongMD, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1334298434.

Like Narrative Control, this mod allows you to restrict the constant flow of NPC
chatter that the game throws at you.

Whereas Narrative Control focuses on the strategy layer, Narrative Honcho
further extends this to the tactical layer. It also gives control over
post-mission narratives (the Propaganda Announcer, and the Speaker) in the
Skyranger.

Some narratives - those which are inextrictably tied to plot progression, or
whose removal othrwise breaks game progression - cannot be safely silenced, but
these are few.

## Requirements

The X2WOTCCommunityHighlander version 1.9 or higher is required for this mod to
work.
