# Field Survival Uniforms

Keeps your troops in uniform.

Adds a button to the soldier view in the armory, which sets a configurable, uniform appearance for all troops.

Edit this via XComFieldSurvivalUniforms.ini.

Defaults:

- Applies the correct basic sleeved variant for the armor the soldier is wearing. Does not break special armors, nor the armor of special classes.
- All non-robotic soldiers receive regulation buzz cuts.
- Upper face props are removed, except that the terminally stylish and/or short-sighted are allowed to retain aviator sunglasses and plain glasses.
- Lower face props are removed, except that smokers are allowed to retain their cigarettes and cigars. There is a war on, after all.
- All armors are military green with the Classic 2 camouflage pattern, straight from the quartermaster.
- All weapons are black with no pattern, fresh out of the crate.
- Tattoo colors are standardized to a plausible dark blue.
- Twitchy soldiers learn how to act by the book.
- Helmets are left alone.
