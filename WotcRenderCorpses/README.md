# WotcRenderCorpses

This mod permits the corpses (and wrecks) of adversaries recovered by XCOM to be rendered down into resources via repeatable research projects, in a similar manner to Long War 2.

Alien Biotech is a prerequisite research tech, along with at least one of the relevant corpse or wreck.

It would be adviseable to autopsy corpses, and complete other research tasks, before rendering them, and to retain sufficient corpses for other research, engineering and construction projects XCOM may need to complete.

## Configuration

XComRenderTechs.ini lists supported render techs. Either comment out, or
uncomment, techs from mods you do/not have.
