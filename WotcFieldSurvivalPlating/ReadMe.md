# Field Survival Plating.

Long War 2 style plating for XCOM 2: War of the Chosen.

## Vests

This mod adds additional plated vests to the game.

It also adds utility slots to most base armors, so these vests can be more easily equipped. (Provided other mods don't remove them.)

*Ceramic Plating*

The base type. Available from the start of the game, and
equipped and equippable by soldiers by default.

- 4 regenerating ablative hit points.
- Reactive plating. Upon taking a hit, for the rest of the turn the vest grants bonus armor, defense and dodge.

*Alloy Plating*

A mid-game vest upgrade unlocked at Plated Armor.

- 4 bonus hit points.
- 6 regenerating ablative hit points.
- Reactive plating. Upon taking a hit, for the rest of the turn the vest grants bonus armor, defense and dodge.

*Chitin Plating*

A late-game vest upgrade unlocked at Powered Armor.

- 8 bonus hit points.
- 8 regenerating ablative hit points.
- Reactive plating. Upon taking a hit, for the rest of the turn the vest grants bonus armor, defense and dodge.

## SPARK Armor

Standard SPARK armor is modified to provide comparable bonuses to the above which similarly upgrades as SPARK armor improves.

## Covert Infiltration and/or Prototype Armoury

The Covert Infiltration mod uses Prototype Armoury.

With the Prototype Armoury mod installed, these vests are built as individual items, rather than built once via a schematic when the relevant tech unlocks. Mid and late game upgrades are still gated by relevant research.
